> 1- Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
> 2- Establish an SFTP connection to the sandbox environment by using the following command: sftp username@hostname. Replace "username" with your actual username and "hostname" with the appropriate hostname or IP address for the sandbox environment.
> 3- Enter your password when prompted to authenticate and establish the SFTP connection.
> 4- Navigate to the directory on the sandbox environment where you want to upload the screenshots using the cd command. For example: cd /path/to/sandbox/directory.
> 5- Use the put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment. Provide the full path to each screenshot file you want to upload. For example:

> > put /Users/YourUsername/folder/screenshot1.png
> 6- To confirm the successful transfer of the screenshots, check the contents of the sandbox directory using the ls command: ls. This will display a list of files in the current directory on the sandbox environment, including the uploaded screenshots
> 7- When you have finished transferring and verifying the screenshots, you can exit the SFTP session using the quit or exit command: quit.
