     1	Elizabeth it is in vain you say
     2	Love not"—thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
     3	In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
     4	Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
     5	Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
     6	Breath it less gently forth—and veil thine eyes.
     7	Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
     8	To cure his love—was cured of all beside—
     9	His follie—pride—and passion—for he died.
